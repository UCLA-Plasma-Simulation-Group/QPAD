**Q**uick**P**IC with **A**zimuthal **D**ecomposition (QPAD) is a quasi-3D parallel (MPI-based) Quasi-Static PIC code, which is developed based on the framework of full 3D QuickPIC. QPAD can efficiently simulate plasma based accelerator problems. This is the UCLA Plasma Simulation Group's official repository for QPAD.

# Read before download

Currently, we are actively developing new program features and fixing known bugs. This means that the update for the program code, as well as the user manual (wiki pages), will be very frequent. In order to be able to use the latest features of the program at the first time, we recommend that you subscribe to this website. All the changes regarding the usage of the code will be updated in the [wiki page](https://github.com/UCLA-Plasma-Simulation-Group/QPAD/wiki).

# Upon cloning the repository

If you clone this repository, we ask that you __please contact__ Fei Li (lifei11@ucla.edu) or Weiming An (anweiming@ucla.edu). The development of QPAD relies on grant funding for which we are required to report code usage, and we would greatly appreciate being able to maintain accurate user-number tallies.
