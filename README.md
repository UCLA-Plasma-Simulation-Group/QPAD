QPAD can efficiently simulate plasma based accelerator problems. This is the UCLA Plasma Simulation Group's official repository for QPAD.

# Upon cloning the repository

If you clone this repository, we ask that you __please contact__ Fei Li (lifei11@ucla.edu) or Weiming An (anweiming@ucla.edu). The development of QPAD relies on grant funding for which we are required to report code usage, and we would greatly appreciate being able to maintain accurate user-number tallies.
